#In this challenge, you actually don't really need to write code.
#Instead you will go back to the counter2.py file and try to break the code.

#What does breaking code mean?
#Breaking code means to find ways to make the code not work as expected.

#Go through the code and think of different ways your program could fail.
#Then make a list of all ways and describe how you would fix them.
#The fix could be as simple as adding or changing a couple lines of code 
#or it could involve downloading a new library and rewriting a big portion of the code.
