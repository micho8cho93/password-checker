"""In this exercise, you will write a password checker that 
checks the strength of a password entered by the user. The program will ask the user for their password,
and then check to see how strong the password is. A password is considered strong if it meets the following criteria:
it is more than 6 characters long, it contains at least one letter, one number, and one punctuation character."""

# Import the string module to access predefined sets of characters such as digits and punctuation.
# Many of the functions below will require methods from the string module
# but it is your responsibility to find and use the correct methods.

# Define a function to check if the password contains at least one punctuation character.
# Loop through each character in the password.
# If any character is found in the set of punctuation marks, return True.
# Otherwise, return False.

# Define a function to check if the password contains at least one numeric digit.
# Loop through each character in the password.
# If any character is a digit (0-9), return True.
# Otherwise, return False.

# Define a function to check if the password contains at least one letter (uppercase or lowercase).
# Loop through each character in the password.
# If any character is an alphabetic letter, return True.
# Otherwise, return False.

# Define the main function to check the strength of the password.
# Prompt the user to enter a password.

# Check if the password is too short (less than 6 characters).
# If so, inform the user that the password must be at least 6 characters long.

# Check if the password is weak:
# - It must be longer than 6 characters.
# - It should contain only letters (no numbers or punctuation).

# Check if the password is medium strength:
# - It must be longer than 6 characters.
# - It should contain both letters and numbers, but no punctuation.

# Check if the password is strong:
# - It must be longer than 6 characters.
# - It should contain letters, numbers, and at least one punctuation character.

# Call the function to execute the password checker.
