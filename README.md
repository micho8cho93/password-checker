# password-checker

In this part of the course, we are going to focus on using external modules/libraries that contain methods created by other developers. We will use a combination of our knowledge of expressions, conditionals, loops, functions and strings to create programs that evaluate password strength. The first exercise will take user input and then based on our password criteria will evaluate and tell the user how strong their password is. In the second exercise, we will build upon what we have done in exercise 1 and ask for a username and password, as well as give the user the option to hide or show their password as they type.

Finally, in exercise 3 we will actually go back to our old code in counter2.py and try to break it! Trying to and understanding how to break code can be good practice and will also help us better analyze our programs and how to write more secure and robust code.
